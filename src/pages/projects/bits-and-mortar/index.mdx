<p className="lead">Gamers have a tough choice—buying a roleplaying game book from a local store supports the community; however, purchasing the game directly from the publisher gets them the book and the PDF version, which they can't get from the store.</p>

Local stores are usually small mom-and-pop shops without a direct relationship with game publishers.

### Bits and Mortar fixes this problem by giving stores a way to distribute PDFs from the publisher.

I worked with Evil Hat Productions, a game publisher and the originators of Bits and Mortar (which was originally a collection of databases and PHP scripts). 

They leveraged their relationships with retailers and fellow publishers to drive people to the site, and I made the experience easy to use.

Successes:

* 850+ retailers are part of the Bits and Mortar program
* 15,000+ files are sent by retailers each year 
* 220+ publishers are part of the program, representing the majority of the tabletop roleplaying game industry
* 24,000+ customers use the site to maintain their digital games library.
