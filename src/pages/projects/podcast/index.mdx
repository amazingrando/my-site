One of my personal goals in life is to make the world a better place, in small and large ways. (It is terrible as a KPI, but it is great as a guiding principle.)

I’m taking a big step towards this goal today. I using my role as Creative Director at a great values-based agency— Four Kitchens — to promote discussions about creativity, community, and values.

Today, the podcast “Design in Good Company” is born. You can find it in the usual places you get podcasts.

It is already a community effort.

My cohost, Brodrick Lothringer, and his team at Pod Pony, knows how to produce a podcast. Their feedback and guidance have helped me grow quickly from loud host to a loud and interesting host.

And you. You’re part of this community too.

I’d like you to join our discussions.

We are kicking things off with a LinkedIn group.

Join us.
