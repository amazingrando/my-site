<p className="lead">Over the years I’ve grown to understand myself better, and a few years ago I started to write down my personal principles.</p>

- Efficiency through laziness
- Assume positive intent
- The only real apology is corrected behavior.
- You can’t control your emotions but you can control your actions.
- Wit is the salt of the conversation, not the food
- Every time someone steps up and says who they are, the world becomes a better, more interesting place.
- Better an oops than a what if.
- Better a horrible end than unending horror.
- Tolerate failure, not incompetence.
